# Registration Process for Armed Forces Course

## Description

This project handles the registration process for candidates applying to a course offered by the Armed Forces. The system allows users to register their personal details, which are reviewed by an administrator. Upon acceptance, the user is required to upload a PDF document (typically a grade or identification document) using a unique URL sent via email. The administrator reviews the uploaded document and decides whether to accept or reject the application. All communication, including registration confirmation and document submission status, is done via email.

The project is split into two main parts:

- **Backend**: Handles data storage, email notifications, document management, and communication between the frontend and the database.
- **Frontend**: Provides the user interface for candidates to register, view their status, and upload documents. Administrators can also manage registrations and review documents.

## Registration Process

1. **User Registration**: 
   - A candidate registers on the platform by filling out their details, including personal information like identification number, phone number, email, and other relevant data.
   
2. **Admin Review**: 
   - After submitting the registration, the admin receives the registration details for review. The admin can accept or reject the user's registration.

3. **Document Upload**:
   - If the registration is accepted, the candidate will receive an email containing a unique URL to upload the required PDF document (such as a grade certificate). This document is uploaded directly to the platform through the provided link.

4. **Document Review**:
   - The admin reviews the uploaded document and either approves or rejects it based on the criteria. The result is communicated to the user via email, and the status is updated in the system.

5. **Email Notifications**:
   - The system sends various email notifications at each step of the process, including registration acceptance, document submission, and document approval or rejection.
